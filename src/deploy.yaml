model:
  name: Speech2Text
  framework: pytorch_fx
evaluation:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in neural_compressor.Quantization.
  accuracy:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in neural_compressor.Quantization.
    metric:
      topk: 1
  performance:                        # optional. used to benchmark performance of passing model.
    configs:
      cores_per_instance: 2
      num_of_instance: 1
tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.01                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.
